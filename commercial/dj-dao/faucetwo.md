## My knobs aren't responding at all

Try holding Start, BT-A, BT-B, BT-C, BT-D, FX-L, and FX-R for 10 seconds. This will swap between encoder and potentiometer mode. 

## How are the buttons wired to the board?

Start goes to 1, BT-A through BT-D are 2-5, and FX-L and FX-R are 6-7.

## Mode 2 and HID Mode Issues

It is reported that Mode 2 and HID mode do not work with USB 2.0 ports and require a USB 3.0 port. 

## Chord Splitting

It is reported that when all 4 BT buttons are pressed, the controller will chord split, resulting in delayed reports back to the game and up to 4ms of error. 

## My Lower Knob / Encoder Bracket Cracked!
