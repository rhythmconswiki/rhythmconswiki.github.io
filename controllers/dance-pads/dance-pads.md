# Dance Pads
{: .no_toc }

Dance games utilize similar construction and sensors, so both [Dance Dance Revolution](https://remywiki.com/DanceDanceRevolution_Information) and [Pump it Up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_It_Up_(video_game_series)) will be on this page.

This page covers full-sized pads. For smaller "Travel Pads", see the [other sub-page]({% link controllers/dance-pads/travel-pads.md %}).

## Sensors

Some builds may use arcade sensors, but these are rather pricey for DIY usage. If desired, a number of stores are listed at the links below:
* DDR Sensors: [https://gamerepair.info/parts/10_dance_pad_floor_switch](https://gamerepair.info/parts/10_dance_pad_floor_switch)
* PIU Sensors: [https://gamerepair.info/parts/15_pump_it_up_floor_switch](https://gamerepair.info/parts/15_pump_it_up_floor_switch)

DIY pads typically use cheaper sensors available from Chinese manufacturers, shown below. They are easily available on Aliexpress with the query "arcade dance sensor". These sensors use JST XH connectors.
